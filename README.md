## Kivean's Dev Repo for BaNDyT: Bayesian Network Analysis of Dynamic Trajectories

BaNDyT (Bayesian Network analisis of molecular Dynamic simulation Trajectories): software package that implements the Bayesian Network Modeling specifically attuned to the MD simulation trajectories data.

This package was prepared and released along with the publication: [BaNDyT: Bayesian Network Modeling of Molecular Dynamics Trajectories (Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling)]( https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c01981)

Tutorial on how to use BaNDyT can be found here: [BaNDyT tutorial](https://github.com/bandyt-group/bandyt-tutorial)

**How to Use**
To use BaNDyT, please refer to the original repo.  This is a development fork for purposes of devloping additional functionality for BaNDyT and including useful functions for the community.  Relevant changes will be pushed to main as they go.
